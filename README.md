# HTTP-Rest-API Using Go & GoFr

Hello and welcome to the world of Go (also known as Golang), GORM, and the innovative GoFr framework. In this Project, we’ll take you on a practical journey to build a REST API using Go, combined with GORM for handling databases, and powered by GoFr Framework.
Before getting started get’s get to know them one by one:

### Go(Golang) :- 
Go, the renowned programming language, provides a solid foundation for building web applications, microservices, and network-intensive tasks with its elegance, simplicity.

### GORM :- 
GORM, the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, acts as a bridge between Go objects and relational databases.

### GoFr :- 
GoFr is Opinionated Web Framework written in Go (Golang). It helps in building robust and scalable applications. It makes creating RESTful APIs and web applications a breeze, even if you’re relatively new to Go. It prioritise simplicity over complexity.
